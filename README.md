# Docker Common Configs
 Comonly used Configuration Files by me
 These configuration files are designed such that instead of installing standalone versions of software
 You could just run the configuration.
 This is especially good for Windows & Linux users as removing files and data has now become much easier

 Even though I have used Batch Format, the Method is cross-platform enough that it would be compatible with Linux OS

## CURRENT IMPLEMENTATIONS
 
1. [Postgres:Alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres "Postgres:Alpine")

    Default Password & Username set to _**postgres**_. Can be changed in Batch File
2. [Eclipse Mosquitto:latest](https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-mosquitto "Eclipse Mosquitto:latest")
